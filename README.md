We propose to develop a platform which will include a real-time location tracking Map which will track the position of victims and volunteers continuously. This map will display the location of Medical Camps, Food camps, Volunteers and other helpful resources for the victims so, that they can reach and get help as soon as possible. For those victims who don't use smartphones, this app will support a USSD service. With USSD service they will be able to inform us about their current state and current location. Depending on rules of the country, USSD service can be used to give consent for location data sharing by cell companies.

# How will this app function?
This app will have three Interfaces: Admin Interface, Volunteer Interface, and Victim Interface.
This app will have the following features:
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    1. A Real-time map for continuous location tracking of victims and volunteers.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    2. Real-Time map will help volunteers reach victims asap.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    3. People will be able to volunteer and help victims using the app.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    4. Admins will be able to add locations of camps and help services on maps to help victims.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    5. Volunteers will be able to assign a status(such as: saved, still in danger etc.) to any victim as soon as they could help them.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    6. Admins will be able to assign volunteers some specific task/group of people to help them on time.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    7. Multiple disasters can be handled at the same time using this app.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    8. Collecting donations from people who are willing to help.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    9. Maintaining stats of the number of people who died and survived during the disaster.
